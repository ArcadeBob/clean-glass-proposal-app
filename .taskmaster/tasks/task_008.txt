## 1. Implement Regional Price Adjustment System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a regional adjustment system that applies location-based multipliers to base costs, accounting for local labor rates, material costs, and market conditions
### Details:
Build a regional adjustment module with configurable multipliers for different geographic regions.

## 2. Develop Size-Based Overhead Rate Calculator [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement dynamic overhead rate calculation that adjusts based on project size, replacing fixed 15% overhead with variable rates that reflect economies of scale
### Details:
Create a tiered overhead calculation system with different rates for project size brackets (small: <$50k, medium: $50k-$200k, large: >$200k). Implement smooth scaling algorithms to avoid abrupt rate changes at boundaries. Include overhead categories (administrative, equipment, insurance) with size-specific adjustments. Ensure backward compatibility with existing fixed-rate calculations.

<info added on 2025-07-22T00:15:10.706Z>
Conducted comprehensive code analysis of the integration between advanced calculation engine and risk assessment system. Identified several missing components that require implementation: missing event listeners for risk assessment updates, incomplete error handling for risk data validation failures, and absence of calculation audit logging mechanism. Found that the unified calculation pipeline exists but lacks proper sequencing controls for regional adjustments versus risk margins. Database schema missing required indexes for real-time performance. Integration tests are incomplete and do not cover edge cases for missing risk data scenarios. Fallback calculation logic is partially implemented but needs refinement for production reliability.
