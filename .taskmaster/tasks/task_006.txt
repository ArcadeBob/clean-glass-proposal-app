# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement advanced risk scoring, market analysis, and intelligent contingency recommendations
# Details:
Build sophisticated risk assessment system with 15+ weighted factors, market analysis capabilities, and intelligent pricing recommendations. This phase adds the intelligence that differentiates the system from simple calculators.

# Test Strategy:
Validate risk scores against expert assessment, verify market analysis accuracy, test contingency recommendations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Risk Factor Database Schema & Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement database schema for storing 15+ risk factors with configurable weights, scoring algorithms, and factor categories
### Details:
Create database tables for risk factors including: schedule risks (weather delays, permit delays, seasonal constraints), technical risks (complexity, new technology, site access), financial risks (material volatility, labor availability, economic conditions), and operational risks (subcontractor reliability, equipment availability). Each factor should have configurable weight (0-100), scoring method (linear, exponential, threshold-based), and category grouping. Include seed data for initial 15+ factors with industry-standard weights.

## 2. Risk Scoring Engine Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the core risk calculation engine that processes multiple weighted factors and generates composite risk scores
### Details:
Implement risk scoring algorithms that take project inputs and calculate individual factor scores, apply configurable weights, and generate composite risk scores (0-100 scale). Support different scoring methods: linear interpolation for continuous factors, threshold-based for categorical factors, and exponential curves for non-linear risks. Include normalization logic to ensure consistent scoring across different factor types and ranges. Generate risk score breakdown showing contribution of each factor category.
