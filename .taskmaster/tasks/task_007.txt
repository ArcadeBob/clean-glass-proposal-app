## 1. Risk Factor Definition and Configuration System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational risk factor system with 15+ configurable risk factors across schedule, technical, site, financial, and seasonal categories
### Details:
Implement a comprehensive risk factor configuration system including: Schedule factors (timeline constraints, resource availability, weather windows), Technical factors (complexity, technology maturity, skill requirements), Site factors (accessibility, utilities, environmental), Financial factors (cash flow, payment terms, market conditions), and Seasonal factors (weather impact, material availability). Each factor should have configurable weight values, scoring ranges (1-10), and descriptive criteria. Create TypeScript interfaces for RiskFactor, RiskCategory, and RiskConfiguration. Store configurations in database with ability to modify weights and criteria.
