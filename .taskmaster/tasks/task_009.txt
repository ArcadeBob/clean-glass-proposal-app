# Task ID: 9
# Title: Market Analysis Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Build cost/SF benchmarking and win probability calculation system
# Details:
Implement market analysis featuring cost per square foot benchmarking, win probability calculations, package recommendations, and historical comparisons. This system helps position proposals competitively in the market.

# Test Strategy:
Validate benchmarking data, test win probability accuracy, verify recommendation logic

# Subtasks:
## 1. Cost/SF Benchmarking Data Collection System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build system to collect, store, and analyze historical cost per square foot data from completed projects
### Details:
Create database schema for storing project cost data with fields for project type, location, size, total cost, and cost/SF. Implement data ingestion service to import historical project data. Build data validation and cleansing logic to ensure accuracy. Create aggregation functions to calculate regional and project-type averages. Include data export capabilities for analysis.

## 2. Market Benchmarking Analysis Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop analysis engine to compare current project costs against market benchmarks and identify competitive positioning
### Details:
Build comparison algorithms that match current project parameters (type, size, location) with relevant benchmark data. Implement statistical analysis to calculate percentile rankings and variance from market averages. Create competitive positioning logic that categorizes proposals as below/at/above market rates. Include confidence scoring based on sample size and data recency.

## 3. Win Probability Calculation Model [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement machine learning model to calculate win probability based on historical proposal outcomes and project characteristics
### Details:
Create feature engineering pipeline extracting relevant variables from project data (cost/SF ratio, project size, client type, regional factors). Implement logistic regression or random forest model trained on historical win/loss data. Build model evaluation and retraining pipeline. Create probability scoring system with confidence intervals. Include feature importance analysis to understand key success factors.

## 4. Package Recommendation System [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Build intelligent recommendation engine that suggests optimal pricing packages based on market analysis and win probability
### Details:
Develop recommendation algorithm that combines market positioning data with win probability scores to suggest pricing strategies. Implement multiple package options (aggressive, competitive, premium) with different risk/reward profiles. Create business rule engine for package constraints and approval workflows. Include sensitivity analysis showing impact of price changes on win probability.

## 5. Historical Comparison and Reporting Dashboard [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create comprehensive dashboard displaying market analysis results, historical comparisons, and actionable insights
### Details:
Build interactive dashboard showing cost/SF benchmarks, win probability trends, and package recommendations. Implement historical comparison charts tracking performance over time. Create exportable reports for stakeholder review. Include drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis. Add alert system for significant market changes or competitive threats. Integrate with existing proposal workflow for seamless user experience.
